            An Intellectual Property clause will inform users that the contents,
            logo and other visual media you created is your property and is
            protected by copyright laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Termination clause will inform users that any accounts on your
            website and mobile app, or users' access to your website and app,
            can be terminated in case of abuses or at your sole discretion.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Governing Law clause will inform users which laws govern the
            agreement. These laws should come from the country in which your
            company is headquartered or the country from which you operate your
            website and mobile app.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Links to Other Websites clause will inform users that you are not
            responsible for any third party websites that you link to. This kind
            of clause will generally inform users that they are responsible for
            reading and agreeing (or disagreeing) with the Terms and Conditions
            or Privacy Policies of these third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your website or mobile app allows users to create content and
            make that content public to other users, a Content clause will
            inform users that they own the rights to the content they have
            created. This clause usually mentions that users must give you (the
            website or mobile app developer/owner) a license so that you can
            share this content on your website/mobile app and to make it
            available to other users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because the content created by users is public to other users, a
            DMCA notice clause (or Copyright Infringement ) section is helpful
            to inform users and copyright authors that, if any content is found
            to be a copyright infringement, you will respond to any DMCA
            takedown notices received and you will take down the content.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Limit What Users Can Do clause can inform users that by agreeing
            to use your service, they're also agreeing to not do certain things.
            This can be part of a very long and thorough list in your Terms and
            Conditions agreement so as to encompass the most amount of negative
            uses.
